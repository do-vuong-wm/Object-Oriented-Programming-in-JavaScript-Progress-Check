# Object-Oriented-Programming-in-JavaScript-Progress-Check

Goals: 

Create an object/s using JavaScript Object Oriented Programming (OOP) which demonstrates an understanding of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. 
Demonstrate an understanding of the difference between object literal notation, and constructor functions with prototyping. 

Instructions:

Plan out your class/objects using a diagramming software like Lucidchart. 
Be sure to export this as a PDF or a JPG image and submit along with your code.
Once you have established what the class/object is, and done planning, it’s time to start coding. 
You need to have at least one .html file to display your object and what it does.
It doesn’t have to be pretty, but bonus points to those who go beyond the basic requirements. 
You must also have at least one .js file.
Your two files must be linked. 
Create at least one class with a minimum of four properties. You may do this using constructor methods or object literal notation, just be careful how you instantiate it. Remember that with the constructor/prototype method, you will be instantiating using the “new” keyword whereas with object literal notation, you must assign an object to the variable at the time of declaration. 
Demonstrate your understanding of encapsulation by encapsulating the properties and methods of the object (this may seem like a no-brainer but I would like for you to make //comments outlining what is what in your objects). 
Don’t forget to instantiate your objects. 
Create at least four sub-classes for your object/s. 
These should demonstrate your understanding of inheritance. 
You may use the new keyword or assign an object to a variable, depending on how you chose to create your objects. 
You must demonstrate your understanding of overriding by adding a new property to the object child class. 
Demonstrate polymorphism used on a structure holding parent and child objects, which you may do by instantiating an array which holds all of your objects and subclass objects. 

NOTE: When you go to turn this project in, there are four things you must do:
Create a new repository and name it after this progress check.
Upload your code to that repository and share the URL through Google Classroom with me.
Get your program on the sites server, share that URL with me through Google Classroom.
Export your planning schematic to a PDF or JPG and share it with me.
